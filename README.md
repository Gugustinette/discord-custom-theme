# Discord Custom Themes
Discord's Custom Themes CSS, but free

## How to use
If you're using navigator [Arc](https://arc.net/), you can create an Arc boost and add the CSS into it.

If you don't have Arc, you can use the [Eris](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eris/jhakgjgcbkfcfiifmphdmbiinekbalej) extension for Chrome.
